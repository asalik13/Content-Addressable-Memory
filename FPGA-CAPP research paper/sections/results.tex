\section{Results}
A Content Addressable Parallel Processor was successfully completed. 
The machine works in conjunction with a machine with Von Neumann architecture that is 
responsible for streaming commands to the CAPP which enacts them on the CAM. 
The commands are sent over serial using a UART module on the FPGA\\\\
As the CAPP works on the principles of a CAM, 
it can search for matching cycles in constant time, 
and write to those in constant time too. 
\\\\
We also wrote a Python library that is used to initialize the CAPP and send commands to it 
from the external Von Neumann machine. 
This makes it easy to transmit commands and read cells in the CAM.
