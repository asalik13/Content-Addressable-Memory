\section{Results}
The Content Addressable Parallel Processor was successfully implemented on a TinyFPGA-BX. It was tested both by manual interaction with the serial USB-UART as well as through a python driver which wraps the protocol in a higher-level object-oriented API. The python driver file also contains a simple test program that serves both as a tutorial and a test-suite for the FPGA based CAPP.
