\section{The Finite State Machine}
The FSM is the crux of interacting with the CAM and making it carry out complex algorithms. 
It has numerous states, some of them are sending or receiving data, loading data into the CAM, selecting first, searching, reading, setting the comparand and mask as well as writing. 
The base UART module used is from David Things' Github repository. \cite{uart} This works on a 48MHz clock cycle.
To reduce complexities and avoid additional LUTs usage, we used the same clock speed throughout the project.
