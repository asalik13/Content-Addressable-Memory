\section{Introduction}
CAM or Content Addressable Memory is an alternate architecture for memory. Unlike RAM (Random Access Memory) which works by performing lookups using memory 
The goal of this project was to design a module for a CAM that is synthesizable on an FPGA using modern HDL tools. 
We also integrated a finite state machine that encapsulated the CAM and a Serial UART module. 
This enabled the researchers to directly communicate with the CAM from a CPU using serial communication.
