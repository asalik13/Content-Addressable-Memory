\begin{abstract}
    We designed a synthesizable module for Content Addressable Memory on a FPGA. 
    The module designed is expandable and can also be used as a co-processor for a Von Neumann based CPU machine. 
    This type of memory is able to provide constant time complexities for searching, reading and writing by leveraging certain circuity around each cell of memory.
