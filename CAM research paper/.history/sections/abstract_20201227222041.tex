    The goal of this study was to design a synthesizable Content Addressable Memory on an FPGA. 
    The module designed is expandable and can be used as a co-processor for a Von Neumann based CPU machine. 
    This type of memory is able to provide constant time complexities for searching, reading and writing by leveraging certain circuity around each cell of memory.
