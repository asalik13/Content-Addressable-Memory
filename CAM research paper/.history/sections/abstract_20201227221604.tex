    The goal of this study was to design implement and optimize a module for Content Addressable Memory on an FPGA. The module designed is expandable and can be used as a co-processor for a Von Neumann based CPU machine. This type of memory is able to provide constant time complexities for searching, reading and writing by leveraging upon cirtain circuity around each
