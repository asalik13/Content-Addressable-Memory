\section{Introduction}
CAM or Content Addressable Memory is an alternate architecture for memory. Unlike RAM (Random Access Memory) which works by 
performing operations for a word by using a memory address, a CAM is able to select multiple memory addresses based on a word. 
Furthermore, a CAM can perform operations like multi-writing into and reading from multiple selected cells in constant time.
This is the reason CAMs are so useful in routers and bridges as they are a much faster way to search for IP addresses to send packets to.

Specific integrated chipsets (ASICs) 
The goal of this project was to design a module for a CAM that is synthesizable on a FPGA using modern HDL tools. 
We also integrated a finite state machine that encapsulated the CAM and a Serial UART module. 
This enabled the researchers to directly communicate with the CAM from a CPU using serial communication.
