\begin{abstract}
    We designed a synthesizable module for Content Addressable Memory on a FPGA. 
    The module designed is expandable and uses a very small amount of LUTs. It can also be used as a co-processor for a Von Neumann based CPU machine using serial communication. 
    This type of memory is able to provide constant time complexities for searching, reading and writing by leveraging certain circuity around each cell of memory.
