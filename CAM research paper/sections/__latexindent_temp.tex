\section{Discussion}
Earlier on, in the late 20th century, CAPPs were disregarded as compared to Von Neumann Machines. 
This was because Von Neumann machines were relatively cheaper and simpler, they didn't have elaborate control circuits to each cell of memory.

Over the years, manufacturing and designing costs have gotten lower which makes it a good time to reconsider them. We think there lies great opportunity in CAPPs.
This alternate architecture can read, search and write within the worst complexity of O(1). 
In the modern computer, that is based on Von Neumann machines, these operations have the worst time complexity of O(n).

CAPPs are widely recognized as a way to do fast lookups. 
Our perspective is that they can used in other ways too.
One of them is already proposed in this paper (neural network caching paper citation). 
Additionally, it can also be used for parallel regex operations, the reachabilit problem,
